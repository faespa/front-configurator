Phase 1

 

Rendering creation: We will have a similar process to the renderings that we just completed for you. We will create a building of 4 stories with a similar aesthetic to the provided reference image.

We will allocate four areas were your finishes will be located. (main fa√ßade, accent1 accent 2 and Soffit.

Along with the main image we will be working on the 2 additional snapshots.

We will be sending sample renderings to get your feedback and once we have the renderingsr in the right spot and with your approval we will move to phase 2.

*we will need to have a selection of four finishes for this first rendering. This first rendering would be the default configuration a user will find when using the configurator.

*The main image will be processed in a final resolution of 3000px wide so it allows some zoom in without loosing quality.

*The two complementary snapshots will be produced at 1500px wide (this images will not allow zooming in).

 

Phase 2

 

Creation of all the finishes option (211) for all the areas were those finishes will be available.

We will need high resolution swatches for all the finishes.

*The dimensions of the actual swatch will be necessary for us to scale the finish pattern properly.

 

Phase 3

 

Coding of the functionality, including data base creation renderings and swatches parametrization and controls.

 

Phase 4

 

User interface Design.; We ill propose a user interface that we will share with you in order to get your insights to make adjustments and define the final aspect.
